## Overview

This guide describes the steps required to deploy the Office 365: Security Optimisation Assessment (SOA) Power BI dashboard using the template provided as part of the engagement deliverables. The dashboard provides a view of the assessment results, a simplified experience to plan remediation activities, and a way to monitor remediation progress over time.

## Requirements

* Power BI Desktop [Get Power BI Desktop](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/fundamentals/desktop-get-the-desktop)
* SOA Power BI Dashboard template (O365 Security PBI Dashboard.pbit)
* SOA Remediation Planning Spreadsheet (RPS) workbook provided from a SOA engagement in April 2022 or later, stored in a SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business document library

## Create Power BI Dashboard using template

The Power BI dashboard template requires a Remediation Planning Spreadsheet (RPS) workbook from an Office 365: Security Optimisation Assessment delivery from April 2022 or later. The RPS must be stored in a document library in SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business. (The document library can be synchronised to a local machine for ease of editing the RPS). The RPS file is named **Contoso – O365 Security Remediation Planning.xlsx**, where **Contoso** is the organisation name used as a prefix by the SOA delivery engineer when preparing the deliverables. For Power BI Desktop to be able to open the RPS, you will need a "direct link" to the document, which can be obtained using the following steps:

1.	In a web browser, open the SharePoint Online or OneDrive for Business document library where the RPS is stored and open to the folder containing the RPS.
1.	Click the **ellipsis** icon next to the name of the RPS file and click **Details**.
1.	In the details pane on the right, scroll down to the **More Details** section and click the Copy icon next to **Path** to add the link to the clipboard.

The direct link will look similar to this when stored in OneDrive for Business:

`https://contoso-my.sharepoint.com/personal/user_contoso_com/Documents/Contoso%20-%20O365%20Security%20Remediation%20Planning.xlsx`

If this is your first-time launching Power BI Desktop, you will need to sign in first. Click the **Get started** button, enter your email address, and click **Continue**. Complete the sign-in process and confirm that your name is present in the title bar. Next, click **File** and then click **Get started** before proceeding with the following steps:

1.	At the Power BI Desktop startup screen, click **Open other reports**.
2.	Change the file extension drop-down to **Power BI template files (*.pbit)**.
3.	Navigate to and select the template file (O365 Security PBI Dashboard.pbit) provided by the SOA engineer and click **Open**.

    ***Note:** If you receive a message saying “Unable to open document. The queries were authored with a newer version of Power BI Desktop and may not work with your version.”, it is recommended that you update to the latest version of Power BI Desktop, though you will still be able to continue with the current version.*

4.	When prompted for the **SharePointURL**, paste the direct link you obtained from above and click **Load**.
5.	Once the report has been created, click **File**, then **Save As**.
6.	Specify a file name, for example **Contoso – SOA Dashboard.pbix**, and click **Save**.

## Publishing the Power BI Dashboard

Publishing a Power BI dashboard makes it available to others within the organisation to be able to consume. Because the data used by the dashboard is being loaded from an Excel workbook, any time updates are made, such as marking a control remediated, the dashboard will need to be refreshed and republished to view the updated data.
To publish your dashboard, use the following steps:

1.	In Power BI Desktop, click **Home** and then click **Publish**.
2.	In the **Publish to Power BI** window, select the workspace you wish to publish to and click **Select**.
3.	Optional: If you are republishing the report, you may be prompted to replace the existing dataset, so click **Replace**.
4.	Click the link presented to open the published dashboard in a browser.

To optionally share your dashboard with others inside your organisation, perform the following steps:

1.	Open the dashboard in a browser and click **Share**.
2.	From the **Share Link** window, ensure **Specific People** is selected, and it is recommended that both **Allow recipients to share this report** and **Allow recipients to build content with the data associated with this report** are <u>not</u> checked (because of the sensitivity of the content).
3.	Enter the email addresses of the individuals with whom you want to share.
4.	Enter an Optional message.
5.	Click **Send** to share the report.

## Overview of Dashboard Functionality

The Power BI Dashboard consists of multiple tabs (pages) which contain filters and charts to provide users with views of the SOA results and remediation progress. Additionally, there are several bookmarks and buttons to navigate between tabs or switch between charts on a given tab.

At the bottom of the pages, you will find tab labels that can be used to navigate between the **Introduction**, **Assessment Results**, and **Remediation Progress** tabs. Alternately, you can use the tabs within Power BI to navigate between them.

### Introduction Tab

The **Introduction** tab is a landing page for the dashboard and will show you who performed the assessment for your organisation and the date of the assessment.

### Assessment Results Tab

On the Assessment Results tab, you will find details of the results from the SOA:

![Assessment Results Tab Screenshot](Images/AssessmentResults.png)

The tab has three main sections:

* **Overall results:** The chart on the top left provides a view of total passing/failing controls from the assessment. The chart on the right shows the results by workload, broken down by recommendation level.  (These charts will not update when you use the filters, so they have a grey background to help differentiate these charts from the detailed results.)

![Assessment Results Static Chart Screenshot](Images/AssessmentResults-StaticResults.png)

* **Results filters:** These filters can be used to show different views in the Detailed Findings section of this tab. For example, if you want to identify which controls are aligning with the Protect cybersecurity function/pillar, you would click Protect under Function to show only those details in the Detailed Findings section.

* **Detailed Findings:** This section will show results based on the current filter.

### Remediation Progress Tab

On the **Remediation Progress** tab, you can monitor your remediation efforts as well as plan future remediation activities:

![Remediation Progress Overview Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress.png)

The bar charts across the top row display the number of controls that have not been remediated (aka Findings), broken down by different categories: Cybersecurity Function, User Impact, Cost and Remediation Effort:

![Remediation Progress Bar Charts Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-BarFilters.png)

In the top-right corner, you will see the number of controls projected to pass a subsequent SOA (a total of the number of controls that passed during the assessment plus the controls you have marked as remediated), represented by a gauge chart:

![Remediation Progress Guage Chart Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-StaticGuage.png)

At the bottom-right corner of the screen, you will a see a chart showing the number of controls pending remediation, broken down by recommendation level and technology workload:

![Remediation Progress Workload Chart Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-Workloads.png)

Below the bar charts at the top are three bookmarks, allowing you to navigate between different views showing the remaining controls to remediate or remediation progress. (You must use Ctrl+click to activate a bookmark in Power BI Desktop.)

![Remediation Progress Bookmark Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-Bookmarks.png)

The Findings by Control bookmark will display a table of the control details that have yet to be remediated:

![Remediation Progress Findings by Control Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-ControlsPending.png)

The **Overall Remediation Progress** bookmark will display a chart showing how many items have been remediated over time (based on controls marked as remediated, as detailed in Tracking Remediation Progress section of this guide):

![Remediation Progress Overall progress Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-RemediationProgress.png)

The **Remediation Progress by Recommendation Level** bookmark will display a chart similar to the Overall Remediation Progress chat but broken down by recommendation level:

![Remediation Progress Recomendation Level progress Screenshot](Images/RemediationProgress-RemediationProgressByLevel.png)

You can click on any bar in the top-row bar charts or any recommendation level in any column in the column chart and all the charts (except the gauge chart of projected pass count) and table of controls will be filtered accordingly.

## Tracking Remediation Progress

The Remediation Progress tab can be used to track remediation progress over time against the original SOA results. The Actual Remediation Date column in the RPS is used to determine the date that a given control was confirmed to pass during the assessment or remediation has been completed by you after the assessment. This field will already be populated with the date the SOA analysis was performed for every control that has a result of Pass. When you have remediated a control based on the recommendations from the SOA, you can populate the **Actual Remediation Date** field of that control with the remediation date in the format YYYY-MM-DD.

**Notes:**
* Do not change the Result field to Pass.
* Do not add any columns between A-V, inclusive.  You may use columns W-Z for any usage you want, but no more, as column AA is used internally by the dashboard.

To update the charts on the **Remediation Progress** tab in the Power BI dashboard, ensure that the RPS file that is being used to generate the content has been saved. Because the Power BI dashboard represents a static copy of the data, you will need to perform the following steps:

1.	If not already running, start Power BI Desktop.
2.	Open the saved .pbix file for the dashboard you created.
3.	In the ribbon, click **Home**, and then click **Refresh**. (If the dashboard is already open, you can simply click **Refresh**.)

This will refresh the data from the updated RPS and the now-remediated controls will be reflected in the various charts on the Remediation Progress tab. Below are examples showing progress over time:

* Overall Remediation Progress
